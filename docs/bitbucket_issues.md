This one-way integration allows you to push your features and requirements in Aha! into Bitbucket as issues. 

## Features

* One Aha! product is associated with one Bitbucket respository.
* Individual features can be sent to Bitbucket using the _Send_ dropdown next to the Integrations field for feature pages.
* All features in a release (that have not already been implemented or sent to Bitbucket previously) can be sent to Bitbucket using the _Send_ dropdown next to the Integrations field for for release pages.
* When a feature is copied to Bitbucket one issue will be created for the feature. If 
  the feature has requirements then each requirement will also be sent as an issue.
* Only the description of a feature or requirement is sent. No tasks or comments are included. 
* Attachments of a feature or requirement are also sent.
* Aha! releases will be created as milestones in Bitbucket.
* After a feature is first sent to Bitbucket, changes to the name, description and requirements, can also be sent to Bitbucket using the _Update Bitbucket Issues_ item in the _Send_ dropdown on the features page or by sending all features in a release to Bitbucket again. New requirements will also be created in Bitbucket, however issues that were created for an existing requirement are not deleted from Bitbucket if the requirement is deleted from Aha!. If an attachment is deleted in Aha! the corresponding attachment in Bitbucket is not deleted.
