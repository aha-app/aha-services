Send a log of activity from Aha! to a Flowdock flow. Configure the integration for a product to send only activity for that product. Configure the integration for the account to send all activity that you have access to.

**WARNING** Sending activity out of Aha! and into Flowdock bypasses the security controls in Aha!. Anyone who has access to your Flowdock flow will be able to see the activity, regardless of whether they have access to that information in Aha!

## Configuration

Configure a flow in Flowdock

1. In Flowdock, open the settings for the flow you want to send Aha! activity to. 
2. On the _Inbox sources_ tab, copy the _Flow API token_ value.

Create the integration in Aha!

1. Enter the token from step 4 above into the _Flow API token_ field.
2. Click the _Test connection_ button. After a short delay you should see a message appear in your Flowdock flow in the room you selected.
3. Enable the integration.
4. Consider renaming this integration with your flowdock room name for easy future reference. Perhaps something like: "Flowdock: Customers." You can do this by clicking the _Flowdock_ text in the heading of this page.
