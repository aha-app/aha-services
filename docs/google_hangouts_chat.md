Send a log of activity from Aha! to a Google Hangouts Chat room. Configure the integration for a product to send only activity for that product. Configure the integration for the account to send all activity that you have access to.

**WARNING** Sending activity out of Aha! and into Google Hangouts Chat bypasses the security controls in Aha!. Anyone who has access to your Slack channel will be able to see the activity, regardless of whether they have access to that information in Aha!

## Configuration

1. When creating your webhook add: `https://secure.aha.io/assets/logos/aha_square_300.png` as the webhook image
1. Copy your webhook URL
1. Click the _Test connection_ button. After a short delay you should see a message appear in the Google Hangouts Chat room you copied the webhook from.
1. Customize the channel by selecting the activities which you would like to appear in your Google Hangouts Chat room.
1. Enable the integration.
1. Consider renaming this integration with your Google Hangouts Chat room name for easy future reference. Perhaps something like: "Google Hangouts: #customers." You can do this by clicking the _Google Hangouts Chat_ text in the heading of this page.
