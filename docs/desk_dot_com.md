The Desk.com app allows you to create ideas in Aha! from Desk.com cases. You can also link existing ideas to existing cases.

To use the Desk.com app you must:

* Have at least the Contributor role for for the products that you want to submit ideas to.
* Have the Administrator role in your Aha! account.

The app will use one user account within Aha! for all Desk.com agents - so there is no need to have an Aha! user for each agent.

The Desk.com app is configured within Desk.com:
