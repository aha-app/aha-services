The Salesforce integration allows users in Salesforce to create new ideas in Aha! from Salesforce opportunities and cases. 

This integration allows Aha! to communicate to Salesforce to create links between Salesforce records and Aha! ideas. The integration also allows Aha! to update Salesforce when ideas are modified in Aha! - changes to the name of an idea or the status of an idea will immediately update Salesforce.

## Configuration

To use the integration you must first install the Aha! app within your Salesforce account. Use the [installation instructions](http://support.aha.io/hc/en-us/articles/203880429) to get the app installed.

You need to be a Administrator in Aha! to set up this integration.

1. Add the integration under _Account Settings_ (the Salesforce integration is for the entire Aha! account).
2. Click the _Authenticate_ button to enter Salesforce credentials.
3. Choose the idea portal that will be linked to Salesforce.
3. Click the _Test connection_ button to verify your credentials are correct and send the idea portal configuration to Salesforce.
4. Enable the integration.
