Send a log of activity from Aha! to a Microsoft Teams channel. Configure the integration for a product to send only activity for that product. Configure the integration for the account to send all activity that you have access to.

**WARNING** Sending activity out of Aha! and into Microsoft Teams bypasses the security controls in Aha!. Anyone who has access to your Microsoft Team will be able to see the activity, regardless of whether they have access to that information in Aha!
