The Zendesk app allows you to create ideas in Aha! from Zendesk tickets. You can also link existing ideas to existing tickets.

To use the Zendesk app you must:

* Have at least the Contributor role for for the products that you want to submit ideas to.
* Have the Administrator role in your Aha! account.

The app will use one user account within Aha! for all Zendesk agents - so there is no need to have an Aha! user for each agent.

The Zendesk app is configured within Zendesk:

1. In your Zendesk agent interface, navigate to the _Apps Marketplace_.
2. Find and install the Aha! app.
