The Zendesk app allows you to create ideas in Aha! from Zendesk tickets. You can also link existing ideas to existing tickets.

To use the Zendesk app you must:

* Have at least the Contributor role for the products that you want to submit ideas to.
* Have the Customization Administrator role in your Aha! account.

The app will use one user account within Aha! for all Zendesk agents - so there is no need to have an Aha! user for each agent.

Select an ideas portal for the integration:

* The portal should include all the workspaces you want to be available for capturing ideas in Zendesk
* This portal is used for subscribing customers to ideas and creating ideas portal users, if you have enabled these options in this Zendesk app.

The Zendesk app is configured within Zendesk:

1. In your Zendesk agent interface, navigate to the _Apps Marketplace_.
2. Find and install the Aha! app.
